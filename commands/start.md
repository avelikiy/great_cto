You are the Great CTO setup command for **new projects**.

## Pre-flight: cwd is the project root

Before everything else, verify that the working directory **IS** the new
project's root. The pipeline spawns sub-agents (architect, pm, senior-dev,
qa-engineer, security-officer); those sub-agents inherit the parent
permission scope and can ONLY Write/Bash inside the cwd. They cannot be
granted access to a different path at runtime — that is a Claude Code
design constraint (see `agents/_shared/sandbox-cwd-policy.md`).

```bash
echo "cwd=$(pwd)"
```

If the cwd is not the directory you want the new project to live in, **stop
and tell CTO to `cd` first**:

```
You're in $(pwd). Sub-agents will write to THIS directory.

If that's not what you want:
  mkdir ~/code/<slug> && cd ~/code/<slug> && /start "<description>"

Then re-run /start. Do NOT continue from here.
```

Proceed only when cwd is the intended project root.

## Guard: existing project

```bash
ls .great_cto/PROJECT.md 2>/dev/null && echo "EXISTS" || echo "NEW"
ls .great_cto/DISCOVERY-NO-BUILD.md 2>/dev/null && echo "NO_BUILD"
```

If EXISTS → stop and tell CTO. **First option must be the new-project escape hatch** — most CTOs hit this guard because they meant to start a NEW project but forgot to `cd` into a fresh directory:

```bash
# Predict slug from first 2 nouns in the description (skip filler verbs).
# E.g. /start "build news agent for hashtags" → SLUG="news-agent"
SLUG=$(printf '%s' "$DESCRIPTION" | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' \
  | sed -E 's/^(build|create|make|add|setup|implement|design) //' \
  | awk '{print $1"-"$2}' | sed 's/[^a-z0-9-]//g' | cut -c1-30)
[ -z "$SLUG" ] && SLUG="new-project"
```

Output:
```
Project already configured as `<type>` (from .great_cto/PROJECT.md in $(pwd)).

You're inside an existing great_cto project. Three options, in order of likelihood:

  1. **You meant a NEW project** (most common — wrong cwd):
     mkdir ../<SLUG> && cd ../<SLUG> && /start "<description>"

  2. **You want to add a feature TO this project**:
     Tell me what to build → pipeline starts immediately on this codebase

  3. **You want to re-audit / reset this project**:
     /audit            — gap analysis of existing code
     rm .great_cto/PROJECT.md && /start "..."   — reset config

Do NOT proceed until CTO picks one.
```

Do NOT proceed with setup. Do NOT overwrite PROJECT.md. Do NOT silently fall back to free-form Q&A — that's the failure mode this guard exists to prevent.

If NO_BUILD → stop and tell CTO:
```
Previous discovery decided NOT to build (see DISCOVERY-NO-BUILD.md).

Reason: <quote "Why no build" section, first sentence>
Vendor chosen / evaluated: <from action items>
Revisit due: <created date + 6 months>

Options:
  • Re-confirm — keep using the vendor
  • Supersede — conditions changed (revenue / scale / customization). Tell me what changed → I'll re-run discovery
  • Delete .great_cto/DISCOVERY-NO-BUILD.md → reset and run /start fresh
```
Do NOT proceed with setup. Do NOT overwrite the no-build decision.

---

## Guard: no description

If CTO ran `/start` with no argument (empty) → ask ONE question:
> "What are you building? Describe your project in a sentence or two."

Wait for the answer. Then proceed with setup.

---

## Phase 0: Discovery (when input is sparse)

**Trigger** (any one is sufficient):
- Description shorter than 8 words after the empty-description guard
- Vague intent: "explore / figure out / not sure / what's best" + no domain noun
- Conflicting archetype signals (top-2 scores within 1.5 points after Step 1)
- User wrote a goal, not a deliverable ("I want to learn LLM stuff")
- **AI hard-trigger**: type detection returns `ai-agent | agent-product | rag-system | ml-training | ml-serving | mcp-server | voice-agent | multimodal-app | computer-vision | recommendation-engine | anomaly-detection | llm-ops` — Discovery is **always** required for these regardless of description length. Specific AI questions: audience (internal vs customer-facing), compliance (EU AI Act trigger? GDPR memory?), data residency (which regions cannot leave?), kill-switch (who turns it off, in what time?), monthly cost cap USD, eval set source (golden examples ready or need to be built?). Mode question is mandatory: PoC / MVP / production?

**If triggered** — DO NOT proceed to Step 1 type detection. Run the discovery protocol instead:

1. **Read the framework**: `skills/great_cto/references/discovery.md`
2. **Ask 2–3 questions at a time** using the `AskUserQuestion` tool. Do NOT dump all 8 at once. Stop early when archetype + size become clear (most projects need 4–5 answers).
3. **Map answers → PROJECT.md fields** using the mapping table in the skill doc.
4. **Propose 2–3 approaches** (Option A / B / C) with explicit tradeoffs. Option C must consider "don't build it — use existing tool X" or "use /poc instead of /start".
5. **Wait for CTO choice.** Only then proceed to Step 3 (Create PROJECT.md). Skip Step 1 type detection if discovery already determined the archetype.
6. **Set `discovery: completed`** in PROJECT.md and store the chosen approach in `discovery-summary` for `architect` to read at ARCH time.

**Open-ended fallback**: if user says "I want to talk through this freely" or Q1 reveals "I'm not sure who would use it" → invoke `superpowers:brainstorming` skill instead of structured Q&A. Discovery narrows scope; brainstorming finds scope.

**If NOT triggered** → proceed to Step 1 normally.

---

## Guard: discovery / research / MVP

Before type detection, scan the description for signals that the task is **not yet ready for the pipeline**.

**Discovery signals** (check semantically, not keyword-only):
- Vague intent: "explore", "research", "experiment", "figure out", "not sure what", "maybe", "should we", "what's the best way", "help me decide"
- Unvalidated idea: "validate", "prototype quickly", "test the idea", "proof of concept", "PoC", "see if it works"
- Greenfield with no requirements: "MVP", "from scratch", "brand new", "starting fresh" + no domain/stack signals

**Do NOT trigger** if description has clear deliverables despite containing these words:
- "research and then build X" → build X is the deliverable
- "prototype JWT auth" → auth is the domain, prototype just means small scope

**If triggered**, stop and respond:

```
⚠ This sounds like a discovery or research task.

The pipeline works best when requirements are clear:
✓ "Build a JWT auth service with refresh tokens"
✗ "Explore auth options and figure out what to build"

The pipeline (architect → senior-dev → QA → security → devops) assumes
you know what to build. For fuzzy tasks it produces architecture docs
for the wrong thing.

Options:
  → Clarify requirements in chat first, then run /start again
  → /audit — if you have existing code and want to understand it
  → Say "I know what to build" to proceed anyway (your risk)
```

Wait for CTO reply. If they say "I know what to build" or equivalent → proceed normally.

---

## Step 0.6: Autopilot vertical detection (business-function framing)

Before generic type detection, check whether the CTO is automating a **known business function** —
i.e. building one of our **autopilots**. If so, lead with the *flow* (business language), not
"archetype + pack". This is the positioning surface (see `docs/positioning/vocabulary.md`).

```bash
PD=$(ls -d ~/.claude/plugins/cache/local/great_cto/*/ 2>/dev/null | sort -V | tail -1 | sed 's|/$||'); [ -z "$PD" ] && PD=.
DESC=$(echo "$ARGUMENTS" | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]')
V=""
echo "$DESC" | grep -qE "medical cod|icd-?10|\bcpt\b|claim|revenue cycle|\brcm\b|837|clearinghouse|denial|payer"      && V=rcm
echo "$DESC" | grep -qE "contract|\bnda\b|redline|legal doc|attorney|law firm|e-?sign|clause|filing|paralegal"        && V=legaltech
echo "$DESC" | grep -qE "procurement|source-to-pay|supplier|vendor onboard|purchase order|invoice|accounts payable|three-way" && V=procurement
echo "$DESC" | grep -qE "bookkeep|accounting|journal entry|general ledger|reconcil|month-end|close the books|asc 606|gaap" && V=accounting
echo "$DESC" | grep -qE "\bmsp\b|managed it|managed service|rmm|patch management|endpoint|provision access|help ?desk"  && V=msp
echo "$DESC" | grep -qE "tax return|tax prep|\birs\b|form 1040|e-?file|preparer|1099|deduction"                       && V=tax

if [ -n "$V" ] && [ -f "$PD/flows/${V}.flow.json" ]; then
  echo "=== Looks like an autopilot: ${V} ==="
  node -e "(async()=>{const m=await import('$PD/scripts/lib/flow.mjs');const fs=require('fs');console.log(m.renderFlow(JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync('$PD/flows/${V}.flow.json'))))})()" 2>/dev/null
fi
```

**If a vertical matched** — present it to the CTO as the headline:

> You're building the **{autopilot name}**. Here's the flow it runs — {N} automated steps and a
> human checkpoint where a {role} signs the judgment calls. Connectors start as sandbox stubs.
>
> Want me to scaffold this autopilot? (the build runs under the hood; you approve the plan + the ship)

Then set `archetype: {vertical}` in PROJECT.md, note `autopilot: {vertical}` and
`connectors: stub`, and proceed to the normal pipeline (Step 2 onward) — the vertical's compliance
reviewer + human gate are already wired. **Skip Step 1 type detection** (the vertical IS the type).

**If no vertical matched** → proceed to Step 1 normally (generic software project).

---

## Step 1: LLM-based Type Detection

Read plugin files for type detection + archetype resolution:
```bash
PLUGIN_DIR=$(find ~/.claude -name "ARCHETYPES.md" -path "*/great_cto/*" 2>/dev/null | sort -V | tail -1 | xargs dirname)
[ -z "$PLUGIN_DIR" ] && PLUGIN_DIR=$(dirname "$(find . .great_cto -name "ARCHETYPES.md" 2>/dev/null | head -1)" 2>/dev/null)
```
1. **Keywords + Archetype** → read `$PLUGIN_DIR/TYPE_MAP.md` § Type Detection Keywords (keywords → type) + Mapping Table (type → archetype + params)
2. **Pipeline rules** → read `$PLUGIN_DIR/ARCHETYPES.md` (archetype → QA, deploy, thresholds, gates)

Semantically evaluate the CTO's description against each type on a scale of 0–10. Consider intent, domain, architecture patterns, and technology signals — not just keyword counts.

### Edge Case Handling (apply before scoring)

**Case A — Too short / keyword-only** (≤3 words OR only type keywords, no domain context):
- Ask ONE question: `"What does this [type] do? (e.g. who uses it, what data, any scale or compliance needs?)"`
- Do not create PROJECT.md until answered.

**Case B — Contradictory signals** (serverless + kubernetes, monolith + microservices, static-site + realtime, library-sdk + saas-platform):
- Ask ONE question: `"I see conflicting signals: [signal A] suggests <type-X> but [signal B] suggests <type-Y>. Which is it?"`

**Case C — No keywords, intent-only** (top two scores within 1.5 points):
- Ask ONE question: `"Would this have a public API consumed by other services, or is it primarily user-facing (browser/mobile)?"`

**Case D — Overly generic** (top score ≥4 but none ≥6):
- Present top 2–3 candidates, ask ONE: `"This could be a [type-A] or [type-B]. Which fits best?"`

Priority order when multiple cases apply: B → A → C → D. Never ask more than ONE question per turn.

## Step 2: Type → Archetype Resolution

- **Primary type**: highest score (≥6) — specific type (e.g. `voice-agent`)
- **Secondary types**: additional types with score ≥4
- **Archetype**: look up primary type in TYPE_MAP.md → get archetype (e.g. `ai-system`)
- **Default params**: merge from TYPE_MAP.md entry (compliance, qa-extras, security-gate, min-size)

If primary type is not in TYPE_MAP.md → default to `web-service` archetype, warn CTO.

## Step 2b: Auto-detect size, pipeline, and codebase state

**Size detection** — infer from the CTO's description. Three user-facing scales (`quick` / `standard` / `deep`) map to five internal sizes used by agents:

| User says | Signal in description | User-facing scale | Internal size |
|-----------|----------------------|-------------------|---------------|
| "fix", "typo", "rename", "update config", 1-2 files, <500 LOC | trivial change | `quick` | `nano` |
| "add endpoint", "small change", "integrate X" | new endpoint, minor feature | `quick` | `small` |
| "build service", "add auth", "refactor module", "new API", schema change | standard feature | `standard` | `medium` |
| "build platform", "redesign", "migrate entire", "full rewrite", multi-service | cross-cutting | `deep` | `large` |
| Regulated type detected (payment-service, custody-wallet, gxp-system, critical-infrastructure, financial-services, automotive-supplier, iso27001-scope) | regulated | `deep` | `enterprise` |

**Write the internal size to PROJECT.md** (`size: medium`, not `size: standard`) — agents still read internal names. The user-facing label is only shown in the confirmation summary.

**Accept user overrides in either vocabulary:**
```
"make it deep" / "large" / "enterprise"   →  upgrade
"standard" / "medium"                      →  default
"just a quick fix" / "nano" / "small"      →  downgrade
```

Override rules:
- Regulated type → always `enterprise` regardless of description signals
- MANDATORY security gate archetype (see ARCHETYPES.md) + any size → minimum `medium`
- If CTO requests `quick`/`nano` on a MANDATORY type: warn "This type requires security gate — minimum is `standard`. Upgrading." Do NOT allow nano for mandatory types.
- If `min-size: enterprise` in TYPE_MAP.md → enforce enterprise regardless of CTO override

**Pipeline by size:**
| Internal size | User-facing | Agents | Est. time |
|---------------|-------------|--------|-----------|
| `nano` | quick | senior-dev only | ~5min |
| `small` | quick | architect → senior-dev → qa | ~20min |
| `medium` | standard | architect → senior-dev → qa → security-officer → devops | ~45min |
| `large` | deep | full 7 agents + canary | ~90min |
| `enterprise` | deep | full 7 agents + compliance gates | ~2-3h |

**Greenfield detection** — infer from description and repo state:
```bash
# Check if codebase already has source files
SRC_FILES=$(find . -name "*.ts" -o -name "*.py" -o -name "*.go" -o -name "*.js" \
  -not -path "*/node_modules/*" -not -path "*/.git/*" 2>/dev/null | wc -l | tr -d ' ')
echo "src_files=$SRC_FILES"
```
- `SRC_FILES > 10` → likely existing repo
- Description contains "existing", "current", "already have", "our codebase" → existing
- Otherwise → greenfield

**Show detection summary + ask ONE confirmation question:**

```
Detected:
  archetype=<archetype> | scale=<quick|standard|deep> | <N> agents

Pipeline: <agent1> → <agent2> → ... [~<time>]

<If greenfield is ambiguous>: "Greenfield or existing repo? (say \"existing\" if working on live code)"
<If greenfield is obvious>: "Say \"go\" to start — or override: \"make it deep\", \"add security\", \"quick\""
```

Wait for CTO reply before writing PROJECT.md. Show **user-facing scale** (`quick`/`standard`/`deep`) in this summary even though PROJECT.md stores internal size.

### Step 2.5 — Mandatory minimum questions (run BEFORE creating PROJECT.md)

Even when archetype is detected with high confidence, the following 4 fields are ALWAYS required for the architect not to invent assumptions. Use the `AskUserQuestion` tool to ask them in **one batch** (one tool call, four questions):

1. **Mode** — `PoC` / `MVP` / `production`?  Drives gates, security depth, runbooks.
2. **Team size** — `solo` / `small (2–5)` / `medium (6–15)` / `large (15+)`?  Drives parallelism in pm planning.
3. **Cost cap (infra)** — monthly USD ceiling, e.g. `500`, `5000`, `none`. Used by architect to size services.
4. **Geographic scope** — `US-only` / `EU` / `global`?  Drives compliance (GDPR, data residency).

Skip this batch ONLY if:
- The CTO already answered them in the original `/start` argument (parse for the patterns: "MVP", "team of N", "$Xk/mo", "EU customers", etc.), OR
- The CTO explicitly says "skip questions" / "you decide" / "go" — in which case write `mode: mvp, team-size: 1, cost-cap: 500, geo: us-only` as defaults and add `discovery-defaults-applied: true` to PROJECT.md so architect knows assumptions are unconfirmed.

After answers come back, store them in PROJECT.md fields: `mode`, `team-size`, `cost-cap-usd-month`, `geo`, `discovery: completed`.

**Handle override replies** (accept both user-facing and legacy vocab):
- "go" / "yes" / "start" → proceed with detected values
- "existing" / "yes existing" → set `greenfield: false`
- "make it deep" / "deep" / "large" / "enterprise" → upgrade size to `large` (or `enterprise` if regulated)
- "standard" / "medium" → size `medium`
- "quick" / "nano" / "small" / "just a fix" → size `nano` or `small` per signal
- "add security" / "security gate" → add security-officer to pipeline (set minimum `medium`)
- Any other text → treat as additional project context, re-run type detection ONCE. If still ambiguous after 2 rounds, ask: "I couldn't determine the type. Say 'go' to use `web-service` default, or specify the archetype directly (e.g. 'ai-system')."

Do NOT output scoring tables. Do NOT explain pipeline in detail unless CTO asks.

## Step 2c: Cost pre-flight — bill-shock protection (v2.8+)

Before running the architect (first paid agent), surface the estimated pipeline cost so the CTO can make an informed go/no-go decision **before** burning tokens. This is the "Pay-what-you-want" pattern: show the cost, the cap, the remaining budget, and three options (standard / cheap / cancel). It pairs with the hard-cap enforcement in `scripts/hooks/cost-guard.mjs`.

**Estimate by pipeline tier:**

| Pipeline tier (Step 2b) | Estimated cost USD | Estimated wall time |
|---|---|---|
| `quick` / `nano` (config fix, typo) | $0.10 – $0.50 (est $0.25) | ~3 min |
| `quick` / `small` (new endpoint) | $0.50 – $1.50 (est $1.00) | ~10 min |
| `standard` / `medium` (feature) | $3 – $8 (est $5) | ~30 min |
| `deep` / `large` (cross-cutting) | $8 – $20 (est $12) | ~60 min |
| `deep` / `enterprise` (regulated) | $15 – $40 (est $25) | ~90 min |

**Read current cap state** (silently, never block):

```bash
GLOBAL_CFG="$HOME/.great_cto/config.json"
DAILY_CAP=""; ENFORCE="warn"
if [ -f "$GLOBAL_CFG" ]; then
  DAILY_CAP=$(jq -r '.daily_max_usd // empty' "$GLOBAL_CFG" 2>/dev/null)
  ENFORCE=$(jq -r '.enforce // "warn"' "$GLOBAL_CFG" 2>/dev/null)
fi
TODAY=$(date -u +%Y-%m-%d)
TODAY_SPENT=$(awk -v d="$TODAY" '$0 ~ "^"d { for(i=1;i<=NF;i++) if($i~/^cost_usd=/){split($i,a,"=");s+=a[2]} } END{printf "%.2f",s+0}' .great_cto/cost-history.log 2>/dev/null)
```

**Print panel (always — even if no cap, just shows estimate):**

```
📋 PLAN ESTIMATE
────────────────────────────────────────
Pipeline:        <tier> / <archetype>
Specialist:      <archetype>-reviewer auto-loaded
Estimated cost:  $<est>   (range: $<lo>–$<hi>)
Today's spend:   $<TODAY_SPENT> / $<DAILY_CAP>  ($<remaining> left)
ETA:             ~<minutes> min

Modes:
  [y]   standard    — full pipeline (≈$<est>)
  [c]   cheap mode  — route routine triage to Kimi K2 (~−60% cost, ~+15% time)
  [n]   cancel
```

**If `DAILY_CAP` is unset:** show only the estimate row, omit budget rows, omit cheap-mode option (still available via env var but don't prompt).

**Then PAUSE.** Wait for CTO's `y` / `c` / `n`. Do NOT proceed automatically. If they pick `c`, export `GREAT_CTO_CHEAP_MODE=1` (the LLM router reads this and routes more agents to Kimi). If they pick `n`, exit gracefully (no PROJECT.md, no architect).

**Skip the panel ONLY if:**
- `GREAT_CTO_NO_PREFLIGHT=1` is set (CI / scripted runs)
- The user clearly said "go ahead" / "skip estimate" / "just run it" in the description
- size is `nano` AND estimate < $0.50 (panel adds more friction than it saves)

This is the **biggest single UX win** of the v2.8 cost-control suite: the CTO sees exactly what they're spending **before** any agent runs, and has one keystroke to switch to cheap mode. No 34-agent admin UI to configure.

## Step 2d: Auto-attach domain packs (v2.8+)

After archetype + size are decided, run the pack detector to attach overlay packs. Packs ride on top of the base archetype and add their own reviewer agents, threat-model templates, EVAL suites, and human gates — regardless of the base archetype's defaults.

```bash
PLUGIN_DIR=$(ls -d "$HOME"/.claude/plugins/cache/local/great_cto/*/ 2>/dev/null | sort -V | tail -1 | sed 's|/$||')
PACKS=""
if [ -n "$PLUGIN_DIR" ] && [ -f "$PLUGIN_DIR/packages/cli/dist/packs.js" ]; then
  PACKS=$(node -e "
const { detect } = await import('$PLUGIN_DIR/packages/cli/dist/detect.js');
const { suggestPacks } = await import('$PLUGIN_DIR/packages/cli/dist/packs.js');
for (const p of suggestPacks(detect('.'))) console.log(p.pack);
" 2>/dev/null | sort -u | tr '\n' ',' | sed 's/,$//')
fi
```

If `PACKS` is non-empty, write it to PROJECT.md as `packs: voice-pack, clinical-pack, …`. Each pack listed there triggers its reviewer chain at architect time and adds its human gates to the gate registry.

**Available packs (v2.8):**

| Pack | When auto-attached | Adds |
|---|---|---|
| `voice-pack` | telephony provider in stack (twilio/vonage/livekit/deepgram/elevenlabs/hume) OR voice/IVR/TTS/STT in README | voice-ai-reviewer + gate:voice-compliance |
| `clinical-pack` | FHIR/HL7 in stack OR clinical/PHI/SaMD/CDS in README | ai-clinical + fda reviewer + gate:samd-class + gate:clinical-validation |
| `hr-ai-pack` | greenhouse/lever/ashby/workday OR recruit/hiring/resume/AEDT in README | hr-ai-reviewer + gate:aedt-audit |
| `api-platform-pack` | fastify/trpc/graphql/openapi in stack OR public-API/webhook/SDK in README | api-platform-reviewer + gate:api-contract |
| `clinical-trials-pack` | FHIR/HL7/DICOM OR CTMS/EDC/eConsent/CDISC in README | clinical-trials + bio-data reviewer + gate:irb-ready + gate:part11-validation |
| `robotics-pack` | ROS 2 / MoveIt OR robot/cobot/surgical in README | robotics-safety-reviewer + gate:hara-signoff + gate:functional-safety-test |
| `climate-pack` | GHG/Verra/CBAM in README OR synbio dual-use (gene synthesis, AlphaFold, IGSC, DURC) | climate-mrv + biosecurity reviewers + gate:mrv-methodology + gate:durc-signoff |
| `drug-discovery-pack` | rdkit/ChEMBL/AlphaFold OR LIMS/SiLA2/GLP in README | drug-discovery-ml + glp + lab-automation reviewers + gate:model-card-signoff + gate:csv-validation + gate:iq-oq-pq |

**Manual override:** CTO can edit `packs:` in PROJECT.md at any time to opt in/out. To force-add a pack the detector missed, add the pack name and re-run `/audit` to refresh the reviewer chain.

**Reference docs:**
- Full overlay matrix: `skills/great_cto/ARCHETYPES.md` § Domain Overlays
- Per-pack deep knowledge: `skills/great_cto/references/iso-ts-15066-force-limits.md`, `durc-classification.md`, `glp-raw-data.md`

## Step 3: Create PROJECT.md

```bash
mkdir -p .great_cto
```

Write `.great_cto/PROJECT.md`:

```markdown

## Context Query Order (3-Layer Rule)
1. `.great_cto/` — PROJECT.md, logs, brain.md, verdicts — what was decided, what's pending
2. `docs/decisions/` — ADRs, DECISION-LOG.md — architecture choices and rationale
3. Source code — only when editing or layers 1–2 don't answer the question
> Run `/resume` at session start. Run `/save` before ending. Agents follow this order automatically.
## Meta
plugin-version: 1.0.181
```

Notes:
- If primary is `stack-migration`: add `runtime-old:` and `runtime-new:` under Stack
- `project_size` is set from Step 2b detection (can be overridden by CTO at any time: "make it large")
- `greenfield: false` → architect will read existing code before designing architecture
- `phase:` controls what SessionStart hook loads — `implementation` (default) loads CODEBASE.md + HANDOFF.md; `planning` loads brain.md + digest only; `review` loads latest QA + CSO; `release` loads perf-baseline. CTO switches in chat: "move to review phase".
- `approval-level:` single control for pipeline depth. **Two user-facing values** that the CTO specifies in chat:
  - `auto` — no gates (hotfix, trusted automation) → written as `auto`
  - `review` — **default** — arch + ship gates (2 approvals per feature) → written as **`gates-only`** (canonical internal name; agents read this)

  **Advanced** (written verbatim when CTO opts in):
  - `strict` — arch + code + ship gates (adds code review)
  - `expert` — all gates + 2 checkpoints per agent (deep review)
  - `step-by-step` — every substep gets approval (learning mode)

  **Write-time mapping** — PROJECT.md always stores the canonical internal name so agents (which grep for `gates-only|strict|expert|step-by-step`) keep working:
  ```
  user says → stored in PROJECT.md
    auto       → auto
    review     → gates-only   (default)
    strict     → strict
    expert     → expert
    step-by-step → step-by-step
  ```

  MANDATORY archetypes (ai-system, commerce, web3, iot-embedded, regulated) → auto-upgrade from `review` to `strict` (CTO is notified).
- `packs:` auto-detected from archetype:
  - `ai-system` → `[ai-pack]`
  - `web3` → `[web3-pack]`
  - `regulated` → `[enterprise-pack]`
  - `data-platform` → `[data-pack]`
  - `commerce` + `sox` in compliance → `[enterprise-pack]`
  - `web-service`, `mobile-app`, `infra`, `library`, `iot-embedded` → `[]` (no pack by default)
  - Multiple packs allowed: `packs: [ai-pack, enterprise-pack]` for regulated AI systems
  - CTO can add/remove packs at any time in PROJECT.md
- Do NOT include L3, Oncall, or Pipeline version sections (added later via `/audit` refresh or edited by hand as the project matures)
- **Optional Grafana fields** (add to `## L3` section when project uses Grafana for monitoring):
  ```
  ## L3
  error-log: /var/log/app.log          # fallback if Grafana is down
  port: 3000
  p0-threshold: error_rate > 5%/5min
  p1-threshold: latency > 500ms
  oncall: @alice
  grafana-url: https://grafana.example.com
  grafana-api-key-env: GRAFANA_API_KEY  # env var name (not the key itself)
  loki-datasource: Loki
  tempo-datasource: Tempo
  ```
  These 4 Grafana fields activate native Loki/Tempo/alert monitoring in `l3-support`. Omit if not using Grafana — file-based fallback is automatic. Setup: `mcp-servers/grafana.md`.

Initialize Beads:
```bash
# bd init with fallback: if Dolt backend unavailable, create tasks.md manually
if bd init 2>/dev/null && bd list --status open >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  echo "bd: OK"
else
  echo "bd: Dolt backend unavailable — using .great_cto/tasks.md fallback"
  [ ! -f .great_cto/tasks.md ] && printf '# Tasks\n\n| id | title | status | owner |\n|----|-------|--------|-------|\n' > .great_cto/tasks.md
fi
```

**Seed brain.md** (always — even for nano projects):
```bash
if [ ! -f ".great_cto/brain.md" ]; then
  PROJECT_NAME=$(grep -m1 "^# " .great_cto/PROJECT.md 2>/dev/null | sed 's/^# //' || echo "Untitled")
  cat > .great_cto/brain.md << BRAINEOF
# Project Brain — ${PROJECT_NAME}
> Compiled truth. Updated by /digest (dream cycle). Read by architect before designing.
> Do NOT edit manually. Evidence is appended; synthesis is recomputed from evidence.

## Current Synthesis

## Evidence Timeline
_Appended by agents and /digest. Oldest at bottom, newest at top._

BRAINEOF
  echo "brain.md initialized → .great_cto/brain.md"
fi
```

**Seed DECISION-LOG.md** (always — for non-architectural decisions):
```bash
mkdir -p docs/decisions
if [ ! -f "docs/decisions/DECISION-LOG.md" ]; then
  cat > docs/decisions/DECISION-LOG.md << 'DLOGEOF'
# Decision Log

> Non-architectural decisions — process, vendors, waivers, reversible calls.
> For architecture decisions, see ADR files in this same directory.
> Appended by the CTO via "log decision" or "we decided X" in chat.

DLOGEOF
  echo "DECISION-LOG.md initialized → docs/decisions/DECISION-LOG.md"
fi
```

**Create session logs directory** (for `/save` and `/resume`):
```bash
mkdir -p .great_cto/logs
echo "logs/: initialized → .great_cto/logs/"
```

**Team size → initialize ownership scaffold** (if team-size ≥ 5):
```bash
TEAM_SIZE=$(grep "^team-size:" .great_cto/PROJECT.md 2>/dev/null | awk '{print $2}' | tr -d '[:alpha:]' || echo "1")
if [ "${TEAM_SIZE:-1}" -ge 5 ] && [ ! -f ".great_cto/OWNERSHIP.md" ]; then
  # Detect service roots from codebase
  SERVICES=$(find . -maxdepth 3 \( -name "package.json" -o -name "pyproject.toml" -o -name "go.mod" \) \
    -not -path "*/node_modules/*" -not -path "*/.git/*" 2>/dev/null | sed 's|/[^/]*$||' | sort -u | head -10)
  [ -z "$SERVICES" ] && SERVICES=$(find . -maxdepth 2 -type d -not -path "*/.git/*" -not -path "*/node_modules/*" -not -name ".*" 2>/dev/null | head -5)

  cat > .great_cto/OWNERSHIP.md << 'OWNEREOF'
# Ownership Map
> Auto-scaffolded by /start. Fill in Team, Architect, On-call, Slack, SLA columns.
> To rebuild from git history: /ownership map
> To update one entry: /ownership set <path> <team>

## Services

| Path | Team | Architect | On-call | Slack | SLA | Notes |
|------|------|-----------|---------|-------|-----|-------|
OWNEREOF

  for SVC in $SERVICES; do
    printf '| %s | — | — | — | — | — | — |\n' "$SVC" >> .great_cto/OWNERSHIP.md
  done

  printf '\n## Teams\n| Team | Slack | Lead |\n|------|-------|------|\n| — | — | — |\n' >> .great_cto/OWNERSHIP.md
  echo "OWNERSHIP.md scaffolded → .great_cto/OWNERSHIP.md (fill in team details)"
fi
```

Create global preferences file if not exists:
```bash
mkdir -p ~/.great_cto
if [ ! -f ~/.great_cto/preferences.md ]; then
cat > ~/.great_cto/preferences.md << 'EOF'
# Great CTO — Global Preferences
# Applied across ALL projects. Uncomment and edit lines to activate.

## Gates
# skip-arch-gate-for: hotfix, patch

## Deploy
# default-deploy-target: staging

## Notifications
# p0-only: true
EOF
fi
```

## Step 4: Auto-install domain agents from catalog

The plugin ships specialist reviewer agents for each archetype. Auto-enable the domain-specific ones:

| Archetype | Domain agents to activate |
|-----------|--------------------------|
| `ai-system` | `great_cto-ai-security-reviewer`, `great_cto-ai-prompt-architect`, `great_cto-ai-eval-engineer` |
| `agent-product` | `great_cto-ai-security-reviewer`, `great_cto-ai-eval-engineer` |
| `commerce` | `great_cto-pci-reviewer` |
| `fintech` | `great_cto-pci-reviewer`, `great_cto-regulated-reviewer` |
| `healthcare` | `great_cto-regulated-reviewer` |
| `regulated` | `great_cto-regulated-reviewer` |
| `enterprise-saas` | `great_cto-enterprise-saas-reviewer` |
| `web3` | `great_cto-oracle-reviewer` |
| `iot-embedded` | `great_cto-firmware-reviewer` |
| `browser-extension` | `great_cto-web-store-reviewer` |
| `mobile-app` | `great_cto-mobile-store-reviewer` |
| `data-platform` | `great_cto-data-platform-reviewer` |
| `mlops` | `great_cto-mlops-reviewer` |
| `streaming` | `great_cto-streaming-reviewer` |
| `marketplace` | `great_cto-marketplace-reviewer` |
| `cms` | `great_cto-cms-reviewer` |
| `infra` | `great_cto-infra-reviewer` |
| `library` | `great_cto-library-reviewer` |
| `cli-tool` | `great_cto-cli-reviewer` |
| `game` | `great_cto-game-reviewer` |
| `devtools` | `great_cto-devtools-reviewer` |

All 30 agents are already installed via SessionStart hook. This step just reminds the CTO which ones apply to their archetype.

Report: "Domain agents for `<archetype>`: <list of 1-3 relevant names>. All 30 agents available via `@great_cto-<name>`."

Then also search external catalog for additional domain agents:
```bash
CATALOG=~/.great_cto/catalog/cli-tool/components/agents
find "$CATALOG" -name "*.md" 2>/dev/null | sort | xargs grep -il "<keyword>" | head -5
```

For each match: copy to `~/.claude/agents/<name>.md`. Report count only: "+N from catalog"

If catalog unavailable: skip silently.

## Step 5: Set up weekly automation

After writing PROJECT.md, create two scheduled tasks using the `mcp__scheduled-tasks__create_scheduled_task` tool:

**Task 1 — Weekly Digest** (every Monday 9:00 AM):
```
taskId: <project-slug>-weekly-digest
description: Weekly DORA metrics digest for <project-name>
cronExpression: 0 9 * * 1
prompt: |
  Run /digest for the last 7 days in <project-directory>.
  Save output to .great_cto/digest-latest.md.
  End with one CTO recommendation based on highest-signal problem.
```

**Task 2 — Weekly Audit** (every Sunday 23:00):
```
taskId: <project-slug>-weekly-audit
description: Weekly dependency + secrets audit for <project-name>
cronExpression: 0 23 * * 0
prompt: |
  Run lightweight /audit in <project-directory>:
  1. npm audit / pip-audit / cargo audit
  2. Secrets scan in src/
  3. Flag P0/P1 CVEs from .great_cto/cache/ older than 7 days
  Write results to docs/audits/AUDIT-AUTO-<date>.md
  If P0 found: prepend "⚠ ACTION REQUIRED" to summary.
```

Replace `<project-slug>`, `<project-name>`, `<project-directory>` with actual values from PROJECT.md.

**Task 3 — Quarterly Architecture Review** (only if `project_size: medium` or larger — 1st of Jan/Apr/Jul/Oct at 10:00):

```
taskId: <project-slug>-quarterly-review
description: Quarterly architecture review for <project-name>
cronExpression: 0 10 1 1,4,7,10 *
prompt: |
  Run /digest architecture in <project-directory>.
  Writes draft ARCH-REVIEW-<YEAR>-Q<N>.md. CTO reviews before finalization.
  See skills/great_cto/references/quarterly-review.md.
```

Skip Task 3 for `project_size: nano` or `small` — Q-review is overkill for those.

Silent on success — note only: "Weekly automation: digest (Mon 9:00) + audit (Sun 23:00) scheduled [+ quarterly review if medium+]."
If `mcp__scheduled-tasks__create_scheduled_task` unavailable: skip silently, note "Scheduled tasks: tool unavailable — run /digest and /audit manually each week."

## Step 5b: Ensure `.env.local` is git-ignored

Before finishing, make sure `.env.local` is in `.gitignore` — we use it for
any secret config (OpenRouter keys, per-project API tokens):

```bash
if [ -f .gitignore ]; then
  grep -qxF '.env.local' .gitignore || printf '\n# great_cto secrets\n.env.local\n' >> .gitignore
else
  printf '.env.local\n' > .gitignore
fi
```

**Optional: LLM router (cost saver)** — mention once, do not block. If CTO
wants to delegate cheap tasks (log triage, summarization, POC smoke tests) to
Kimi K2 via OpenRouter (~25% cost reduction):

```
Optional: save ~25% on LLM costs by routing non-critical tasks to Kimi K2.
  1. Get a key at https://openrouter.ai/keys
  2. echo "OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-v1-..." >> .env.local
  3. Restart session — agents auto-detect and use it.

Skip? Pipeline works fine on Anthropic only.
```

See `skills/great_cto/references/llm-router.md` for full details.

## Step 5c: Infrastructure pre-flight

Run this block and show any warnings in the Step 6 confirmation. Do NOT block — just warn.

```bash
echo "=== Pre-flight checks ==="

# ── 1. Beads (bd) — task tracking ─────────────────────────────────────────
BD_OK=false
if command -v bd >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  # bd is installed — check if Dolt backend actually works (CGO requirement)
  if bd list --status open >/dev/null 2>&1; then
    BD_OK=true
    echo "  ✓ bd: OK (Dolt backend active)"
  else
    echo "  ⚠ bd: installed but Dolt backend unavailable (missing CGO build)"
    echo "    Task tracking will use .great_cto/tasks.md as fallback."
    echo "    Fix: install pre-built bd binary from https://github.com/steveyegge/beads/releases"
    echo "         or: CGO_ENABLED=1 go install github.com/steveyegge/beads/cmd/bd@latest"
    # Create lightweight fallback task file if not exists
    if [ ! -f .great_cto/tasks.md ]; then
      printf '# Tasks\n\n| id | title | status | owner |\n|----|-------|--------|-------|\n' > .great_cto/tasks.md
      echo "    Created .great_cto/tasks.md for manual tracking."
    fi
  fi
else
  echo "  ⚠ bd: not found — task tracking unavailable"
  echo "    Install: go install github.com/steveyegge/beads/cmd/bd@latest (needs CGO)"
  echo "    Fallback: .great_cto/tasks.md will be used for task tracking"
  if [ ! -f .great_cto/tasks.md ]; then
    printf '# Tasks\n\n| id | title | status | owner |\n|----|-------|--------|-------|\n' > .great_cto/tasks.md
  fi
fi

# ── 2. Worktree hooks — required for senior-dev parallel isolation ─────────
WORKTREE_OK=false
SETTINGS_FILE="${CLAUDE_SETTINGS_PATH:-$HOME/.claude/settings.json}"
if grep -q "WorktreeCreate" "$SETTINGS_FILE" 2>/dev/null; then
  WORKTREE_OK=true
  echo "  ✓ worktree hooks: configured (senior-dev can run in parallel)"
else
  echo "  ⚠ worktree hooks: NOT configured — senior-dev will run without isolation"
  echo "    Parallel senior-dev tasks are safe but share the working directory."
  echo "    Fix: add to ~/.claude/settings.json:"
  printf '    "hooks": { "WorktreeCreate": [{"hooks": [{"type": "command", "command": "git worktree add <path> -b <branch>"}]}], "WorktreeRemove": [{"hooks": [{"type": "command", "command": "git worktree remove <path>"}]}] }\n'
fi

# ── 3. Git repo — required for worktrees and history ──────────────────────
if git rev-parse --git-dir >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  COMMIT_COUNT=$(git rev-list --count HEAD 2>/dev/null || echo 0)
  if [ "$COMMIT_COUNT" -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "  ⚠ git: repo exists but has NO commits — worktrees need at least one commit"
    echo "    Fix: git add . && git commit -m 'chore: initial commit'"
  else
    echo "  ✓ git: $COMMIT_COUNT commit(s)"
  fi
else
  echo "  ⚠ git: not a git repository — run: git init && git add . && git commit -m 'chore: initial commit'"
fi

# ── 4. LLM router (OPENROUTER_API_KEY) ───────────────────────────────────
ROUTER_KEY=""
[ -n "$OPENROUTER_API_KEY" ] && ROUTER_KEY="$OPENROUTER_API_KEY"
[ -z "$ROUTER_KEY" ] && [ -f .env.local ] && ROUTER_KEY=$(grep '^OPENROUTER_API_KEY=' .env.local 2>/dev/null | head -1 | cut -d= -f2- | tr -d '"'"'"')
[ -z "$ROUTER_KEY" ] && [ -f ~/.great_cto/secrets.env ] && ROUTER_KEY=$(grep '^OPENROUTER_API_KEY=' ~/.great_cto/secrets.env 2>/dev/null | head -1 | cut -d= -f2- | tr -d '"'"'"')

if [ -n "$ROUTER_KEY" ]; then
  echo "  ✓ LLM router: OPENROUTER_API_KEY found (~25% cost saving active)"
else
  echo "  ℹ LLM router: not configured (optional)"
  echo "    Add key to ~/.great_cto/secrets.env to save ~25% on non-critical tasks."
  # Ensure secrets.env template exists for the user to fill in
  if [ ! -f ~/.great_cto/secrets.env ]; then
    mkdir -p ~/.great_cto
    printf '# great_cto secrets\n#OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-v1-...\n' > ~/.great_cto/secrets.env
    echo "    Created ~/.great_cto/secrets.env — add your key there."
  fi
fi

echo "=== Pre-flight done ==="
```

In Step 6 confirmation, if any warnings fired, append them as a `⚠ Pre-flight:` line. Example:
```
⚠ Pre-flight: bd backend unavailable (fallback: .great_cto/tasks.md) | worktree hooks missing (senior-dev non-isolated)
```

## Step 6: Confirm

```
Project: <name> | <archetype> (from <primary-type>) | <stack summary>
Size: <SIZE> | Pipeline: <agent list> [~<time>]
Compliance: [<list>] | Security gate: <mandatory/conditional/no>
Config: .great_cto/PROJECT.md
Weekly: digest Mon 9:00 + audit Sun 23:00
[If team-size ≥ 5: "Team: OWNERSHIP.md scaffolded → run /inbox to see team state"]
[If OPENROUTER_API_KEY set: "LLM router: active (Kimi K2 for non-critical tasks)"]

Tell me what to build.
```

One-liner pipeline in confirmation. No further explanation unless asked.
Overrides at any time: "make it large" / "add pci-dss" / "this is nano" — updates PROJECT.md params.
