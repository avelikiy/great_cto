## Services are the new software

The next wave isn't tools for specialists — it's **autopilots that sell the outcome of a service**.
An autopilot runs a whole business function end to end (intake → process → decide → deliver) and
escalates only the judgment calls to a qualified human. Every model improvement makes the service
faster and cheaper.

GreatCTO ships those autopilots — each one a **flow of agents + tools with a human on the risky
steps**, a built-in compliance reviewer, and a **measured quality score** behind it (not a claim).

## The autopilots

| Autopilot | What it does | Market | Quality |
|---|---|---|---|
| 🩺 **[Medical-coding](https://greatcto.systems/autopilots/rcm.html)** | Clinical notes → clean, compliant claims; a certified coder signs the risky ones | $50–80B | **97.75/100** |
| 🖥️ **[Managed-IT](https://greatcto.systems/autopilots/msp.html)** | Patches, configs & access across the fleet — staged, reversible, human on big changes | $100B+ | **98.5/100** |
| ⚖️ **[Legal-document](https://greatcto.systems/autopilots/legaltech.html)** | Drafts & redlines contracts and NDAs; a licensed attorney signs anything that's advice | $20–25B | **94.75/100** |
| 📒 **[Bookkeeping & close](https://greatcto.systems/autopilots/accounting.html)** | Books, reconciles & closes the month; a controller signs the close | $50–80B | **93.5/100** |
| 🧾 **[Tax-prep](https://greatcto.systems/autopilots/tax.html)** | Prepares returns & classifies positions; a credentialed preparer signs before filing | $30–35B | **92.75/100** |
| 🛒 **[Source-to-pay](https://greatcto.systems/autopilots/procurement.html)** | Onboards suppliers, matches invoices, releases payments — screened for sanctions & fraud | $200B+ | **89.42/100** |

→ [All autopilots](https://greatcto.systems/autopilots.html) · run `/flow <vertical>` to see any flow in your terminal

**Each autopilot keeps a human on the judgment calls** — a certified coder, a licensed attorney, a
controller, a credentialed preparer. The autopilot does the volume; the human owns the call that
carries liability. Connectors run as sandbox stubs today (flip to the real provider to go live).

## Under the hood (for the CTO who runs it)

Each autopilot is built and operated by a gated pipeline of specialist agents — architect, 12-angle
reviewer, QA, security officer, devops — tuned to your stack and jurisdiction. **You make two
decisions per feature; everything else runs automatically.** The compliance reviewer, signed human
gates, audit trail, and the [measured scorecard](https://greatcto.systems/proof) are the trust
layer that makes it safe to let the autopilot run.

## By the numbers

| | |
|---|---|
| LLM cost (one real feature, traced) | **$2.39** |
| Human-equivalent for the same work | **~$5,460** |
| Defects caught that QA had missed | **2** |
| Monthly cost (20 pipeline runs) | **~$34** |
| Specialist agents | **61** |
| Archetypes auto-detected | **26** |
| Jurisdictions | **12** (GDPR · HIPAA · PCI-DSS · SOX · and more) |

→ [Full trace with all artefacts](https://greatcto.systems/proof)

## How it works

**`npx great-cto init`** — scans your stack and README, detects jurisdiction (GDPR? HIPAA? PCI?), writes `.great_cto/FLOW.md` with the exact agents, gates, and compliance frameworks for your project.

**`/start "describe the feature"`** — critics review the architecture and spec before any code is written. You review the plan at `gate:plan`.

**Agents run automatically** — senior-dev implements with TDD, 12-angle review, QA, security, devops. You approve ship at `gate:ship`.

## Three projects — three different pipelines

Same command. Output depends on what you're building and where it runs:

| | **Fintech startup · EU** | **Healthcare portal · US** | **CLI tool** |
|---|---|---|---|
| Specialist agents | `pci-reviewer` · `gdpr-reviewer` · `regulated-reviewer` | `fda-reviewer` · `healthcare-reviewer` · `security-officer` | `cli-reviewer` |
| Human gates | `gate:gdpr-dpia` · `gate:plan` · `gate:ship` | `gate:clinical-validation` · `gate:plan` · `gate:ship` | `gate:plan` |
| Compliance | GDPR · PCI-DSS · SOX | HIPAA · HITECH | — |
| Cost / cycle | ~$8–18 | ~$8–18 | ~$0.5–3 |

## The dashboard you'll actually check

`great-cto board` opens at `http://localhost:3141` — Kanban with realtime SSE, per-agent cost tile, pipeline status, 30-day LLM spend vs human-equivalent baseline.

**Built for the one-person engineering org.** Indie hackers, solo founders, technical CTOs running everything themselves — on Claude Code or OpenAI Codex. *Not for teams* — see [FAQ](docs/FAQ.md#is-great_cto-for-teams).

## Install

```bash
npx great-cto init
```

Restart your AI host after init. **Requires:** Node 18.17+ and one of:

| Host | Install flag | Status |
|---|---|---|
| [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) | _(default)_ | ✅ full support |
| [OpenAI Codex](https://openai.com/codex) | `--host codex` | ✅ hooks + MCP + agents |

```bash
# Claude Code (default)
npx great-cto init

# OpenAI Codex Desktop / CLI
npx great-cto init --host codex
```

Superpowers and Beads companion plugins install automatically — no manual setup needed.

---

<details>
<summary>📖 Full documentation — two gates · critics · 61 agents · 26 archetypes · 12 jurisdictions · 45+ compliance frameworks · board · cost · MCP</summary>

## Two decisions per feature

```
🟡 gate:plan   ←  you decide here (architecture + tasks + cost)
   ↓
🤖 senior-dev → 12-angle review → qa-engineer → security-officer → devops
   ↓
🟢 gate:ship   ←  you decide here (PR ready, security signed off)
```

Architects, planners, reviewers, QA, security, DevOps run automatically between those two human checkpoints. **Memory persists** between sessions: every gate verdict appends to `~/.great_cto/decisions.md`, every retrospective appends to per-project `lessons.md`, and `/crystallize` promotes high-impact patterns to a global library agents query before re-solving.

## Critics before the plan

The most expensive bugs aren't in the code — they're in decisions made before coding starts. Three critic agents run before the Plan stage, at the three positions where a mistake costs the most:

| Critic | Catches |
|---|---|
| **Architecture critic** | Coupling that rules out multi-tenancy later · "obvious" O(n²) on real-scale data · circular dependencies between bounded contexts |
| **Spec critic** | "We solved the wrong problem" — the worst class of bug, because no unit test will catch it · misaligned acceptance criteria · scope that was never agreed on |
| **Schema critic** | `NOT NULL` without a default on a 50M-row table (deadlock in 10min after deploy) · missing `CONCURRENTLY` on index creation · irreversible migrations with no rollback path |

Previously critics only activated starting from Plan. Now the pipeline catches architectural and spec-level mistakes before implementation begins — when reverting costs hours, not days.

## How great_cto compares

|  | **great_cto** | Devin | Claude Code (alone) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Open source | ✅ MIT | ❌ closed | ❌ closed plugin model |
| Self-host | ✅ runs locally | ❌ Cognition cloud | ✅ |
| Host | ✅ Claude Code + Codex | ❌ Cognition cloud | ✅ Claude Code |
| BYOK / multi-model | ✅ Claude Code · Codex | ❌ proprietary | ❌ Anthropic only |
| Specialist agents | **57** (architect · PM · 12-angle review · QA · security · devops · 42 reviewers across archetypes, packs & jurisdictions) | 1 generalist | 1 generalist |
| SDLC orchestration | architect → plan → impl → review → QA → security → devops | one-shot autonomy | edit loop |
| Human gates | ✅ 2 per feature (plan + ship) | ❌ none | ❌ |
| Memory across sessions | ✅ `decisions.md` + `lessons.md` + crystallize | ⚠️ thread only | ⚠️ thread only |
| Cost tracking | ✅ per-agent + 30d history + savings_x | ❌ | ❌ |
| Compliance frameworks | ✅ 33+ (PCI · HIPAA · SOX · GDPR · CCPA · DPDPA · EU AI Act · FDA SaMD · COPPA · FERPA · FedRAMP · NAIC · …) | ❌ | ❌ |
| Pricing | free (you pay your LLM provider) | $500/mo | $20/mo |
| Setup | `npx great-cto init` | sign up | install CLI |

great_cto is **not** another coding-agent loop — it's the **orchestration layer above** the coding agent you already use. Think "specialist team that reviews and gates the work" rather than "another assistant that types code."

## Jurisdiction detection

`npx great-cto init` scans three signal sources — README keywords, infra region strings (Terraform, `.env` `AWS_REGION=`, docker-compose `TZ=`), and `package.json` homepage TLD — and auto-detects which of **12 jurisdictions** apply:

| Jurisdiction | Signals (README + infra) | Frameworks | Reviewer |
|---|---|---|---|
| `eu` | gdpr · eu users · nis2 · eu ai act · `eu-west-*` · `.de` TLD | GDPR · EU AI Act · NIS2 · ePrivacy | `gdpr-reviewer` |
| `us-ca` | ccpa · cpra · california residents · do not sell | CCPA / CPRA | `us-privacy-reviewer` |
| `uk` | uk gdpr · information commissioner · dpa 2018 | UK GDPR · DPA 2018 | `gdpr-reviewer` |
| `in` | dpdpa · india users · rbi data localisation | DPDPA 2023 · RBI | `dpdpa-reviewer` |
| `br` | lgpd · anpd · brazil users | LGPD | `gdpr-reviewer` |
| `au` | privacy act 1988 · oaic · notifiable data breach | Privacy Act 1988 · CDR | `us-privacy-reviewer` |
| `sg` | pdpa · pdpc · mas guidelines · singpass | PDPA · MAS TRM | `us-privacy-reviewer` |
| `ca` | pipeda · quebec law 25 · casl · canadian users · `ca-central-*` | PIPEDA · Quebec Law 25 · CASL · OSFI B-10 | `us-privacy-reviewer` |
| `jp` | appi · japan users · my number · `ap-northeast-1` · `japaneast` | APPI 2022 · PPC Guidelines · FISC | `us-privacy-reviewer` |
| `cn` | pipl · mlps · china users · `cn-north-*` · `cn-east-*` | PIPL 2021 · DSL 2021 · MLPS 2.0 · CBDT | `gdpr-reviewer` |
| `kr` | pipa korea · isms-p · kisa · korea users · `ap-northeast-2` | PIPA · ISMS-P · FSC regulations | `us-privacy-reviewer` |
| `us` | ftc · us users · virginia cdpa · texas tdpsa | FTC Act · US state privacy laws | `us-privacy-reviewer` |

Word-boundary matching prevents false positives (`"india"` doesn't match `"indiana"`). Detected jurisdiction is written to `PROJECT.md` as `jurisdiction: [eu, us-ca]` and gates the appropriate reviewer on every feature. Override manually:

```yaml
jurisdiction: [eu, us-ca]
```

## Three commands you use every day

```bash
/start "build a refund endpoint with PCI-DSS scoping"
# → architect → enterprise-saas-reviewer (PCI-DSS auto-loaded)
# → pm → 5 Beads tasks → gate:plan (you approve)
# → senior-dev → 12-angle review → qa → security-officer
# → gate:ship (you approve) → devops → deployed

/inbox
# Pending gates · P0 incidents · blocked tasks · stale in-progress

/digest
# Weekly DORA + delta vs last week + cost-per-feature roll-up
```

Plus: `/audit` (existing-codebase scan), `/cost` (LLM router savings), `/sec` (security umbrella), `/oncall`, `/release`, `/rfc`. Full list: `~/.claude/commands/` after install.

## Cost

```
~$34/month for a typical solo-CTO project — 20 pipeline runs/month, indicative.
```

| Pipeline | Cost/run | Runs/mo | Total |
|---|---|---|---|
| quick (config / typo) | $0.10 | 10 | $1 |
| quick (new endpoint) | $1 | 6 | $6 |
| standard (feature) | $5 | 3 | $15 |
| deep (cross-cutting) | $12 | 1 | $12 |
| | | | **~$34** |

Pay your own Anthropic API tokens. **No per-seat fee. No SaaS lock-in.** Routine triage auto-routes to Kimi K2 (Sonnet-equivalent at ~5× lower cost) → 60–80% reduction on log clustering.

## 26 archetypes auto-detected

Each archetype activates its own specialist agents and compliance checklists. Top 7:

| Archetype | Tier | Specialist agents | Compliance |
|---|---|---|---|
| `enterprise-saas` | **deep** | enterprise-saas-reviewer | soc2-type-2 · iso27001 · gdpr · ccpa |
| `agent-product` | **deep** | ai-prompt-architect · ai-eval · ai-security | eu-ai-act · owasp-llm-top-10 |
| `fintech` | **deep** | pci · regulated | pci-dss · sox · kyc-aml · gdpr · dora |
| `mlops` | **deep** | mlops-reviewer · ai-eval | eu-ai-act · nist-ai-rmf · iso42001 |
| `library` | baseline | library-reviewer | openssf · sbom |
| `cli-tool` | baseline | cli-reviewer | — |
| `mobile-app` | standard | mobile-store-reviewer | store-policy · gdpr |
| `defense-govcon` | **deep** | cmmc-reviewer · gov-reviewer | cmmc-2.0 · nist-800-171 · dfars · itar · section-889 |

Full table (26 archetypes) + how detection works: [docs/ARCHETYPES.md](docs/ARCHETYPES.md).

**Deep US coverage** — beyond GDPR/PCI/HIPAA, great_cto now reviews against SEC cyber-disclosure (8-K Item 1.05), CMMC 2.0 / NIST 800-171 for defense contractors, US AI governance (NIST AI RMF · Colorado SB 205 · Utah/Texas AI), web-tracking litigation (VPPA · CIPA · Washington MHMDA), and HMDA / SR 11-7 model risk for lending.

## 14 domain packs — overlay reviewers

Domain packs ride **on top of** archetypes. Auto-attached when CLI detects pack-specific signals (deps, README terms). Each pack adds its own reviewer(s), threat-model template, EVAL suite, and human gates — independent of base archetype.

| Category | Packs |
|---|---|
| **AI verticals** | `voice-pack` · `clinical-pack` · `hr-ai-pack` · `drug-discovery-pack` |
| **Digital health** | `digital-health-pack` _(wearable telemetry · mental-health AI · nutrition AI · physician HITL)_ |
| **Fintech / regulated** | `lending-pack` · `em-fintech-pack` |
| **High-compliance** | `clinical-trials-pack` · `climate-pack` |
| **Engineering** | `api-platform-pack` · `robotics-pack` |
| **US market** | `sec-cyber-pack` _(SEC 8-K disclosure)_ · `adtech-privacy-pack` _(VPPA · CIPA · MHMDA)_ · `us-ai-pack` _(NIST AI RMF · Colorado SB 205)_ |

→ **28 human-gate types** + 53 reference EVAL suites + 15 TM templates. Browse all 14 packs with **4-layer journey visualization** (archetype → pack → reviewer → gate): [greatcto.systems/packs.html](https://greatcto.systems/packs.html).

## One real run, fully traced

A Python CLI feature shipped through the full pipeline: **$2.39 LLM spend** vs ~$5,460 human-equivalent. Security caught two real defects QA had passed (`list(stream_csv())` defeated streaming → 14.5 MB peak RSS on 13 MB input). Multi-reviewer model catching what single agents miss, before merge.

Full trace + artefacts: [greatcto.systems/proof](https://greatcto.systems/proof) · raw: [`docs/qa/runs/2026-05-09/E2E-CLI-PIPELINE.md`](docs/qa/runs/2026-05-09/E2E-CLI-PIPELINE.md).

## CI integration

Drop into any GitHub Actions workflow:

```yaml
- run: npx great-cto@latest ci ./ --sarif results.sarif
- uses: github/codeql-action/upload-sarif@v3
  if: always()
  with: { sarif_file: results.sarif }
```

`great-cto ci` auto-detects `$GITHUB_ACTIONS` and emits `::error file=...,line=N::` annotations inline on PR diffs. Exit codes: 0 clean / 1 findings / 2 setup error.

## Test pyramid

Layered test suite — **structural + state-machine tier runs in <2 min for $0** (`node --test tests/*.test.mjs`); real-LLM tier (26 archetypes × 4-8 stages + 14 packs + 13 reviewers) runs on-demand via OpenRouter for ~$5–10. Full breakdown: [docs/testing/](docs/testing/).

## MCP

Native [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) server — **7 tools** callable from Claude Desktop, Codex, or any MCP host. Local (no board needed): `detect_archetype` · `estimate_cost` · `query_decisions`. Board-backed: `project_status` · `cost_summary` · `pipeline_stages` · `recent_verdicts`.

```json
{ "mcpServers": { "great-cto": { "command": "npx", "args": ["-y", "great-cto@latest", "mcp"] } } }
```

Full setup + internal MCPs (Grafana, LLM router, Beads): [docs/MCP.md](docs/MCP.md).

## Email alerts (zero-setup)

Five things that need you to act in <2h get emailed automatically — even when you're away from the board:

| Trigger | When |
|---|---|
| 🚨 **P0 incident** | A P0 task opens in any project |
| ⏸️ **Gate stale > 2h** | A `gate:ship` is waiting on you for hours |
| 🛡️ **Security BLOCKED** | `security-officer` rejected a merge |
| 💸 **Budget alert** | Monthly LLM spend crosses 80% / 100% of budget |
| 📊 **Weekly digest** | Friday 09:00 — shipped, spent, savings, QA |

**Setup**: board → **Notifications** tab → enter email → enter the 6-digit code we send → pick triggers. No Resend signup, no API keys — delivery routed through `greatcto.systems/notify` (free, 100 emails/24h per verified email).

## Limitations & non-goals

- **Not for teams** — solo-CTO is the product. 2+ engineers? You've outgrown it.
- **Not a replacement for senior engineers** — codifies process; doesn't make architectural judgement calls without one.
- **Not a CI/CD system** — gates run locally / in-session. You still need GitHub Actions for actual merge.
- **Not certification-audited** — PCI/HIPAA/SOC2 archetype scaffolds are starting points, not certifications.
- **Not deterministic** — LLM-generated outputs. Every gate verdict should be sanity-checked.

## FAQ (top 5)

**Is my source code used to train models?** No. Claude API zero-retention by default for paying customers. great_cto adds nothing.

**How do you keep token costs down?** Haiku-by-default + Kimi K2 router for triage (60–80% savings) + cost-guard hook.

**Can I disable hooks?** Every hook honors `GREAT_CTO_DISABLE_<NAME>=1`. Per-file secret-scan opt-out: `// great_cto:allow-secrets`.

**What if I'm not solo?** great_cto is built for the one-person engineering org. If you have 2+ engineers and need shared boards / multi-seat auth, you've outgrown it.

## Architecture

The plugin runs inside Claude Code (or any MCP-capable host); 61 agents are markdown specs; tasks live in Beads (dolt, git-native); memory is plain markdown (no vector store). Diagram + stack table: [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).

## What's new

**v2.21.0** (May 2026) — **Flow Compiler UX**: `npx great-cto init` now prints a **Compiled flow** with agents, gates, compliance, and cost estimate per feature cycle. Writes `.great_cto/FLOW.md` — agents read it to know exactly how to orchestrate your SDLC.

**v2.20.0** (May 2026) — **Detection v2**: **12-jurisdiction coverage** (added CA · JP · CN · KR with full legal framework + human gates) · **infra-signal detection** (Terraform region strings, `.env` `AWS_REGION=`, docker-compose `TZ=`, `package.json` homepage TLD) · **word-boundary matching** (no more "india" → "indiana" false positives) · **pack hints** for niche archetypes (`suggestedPacks` surfaces robotics/climate/clinical-trials/hr-ai/em-fintech packs when confidence is low). Token savings: –87.7% per pipeline run (v2.19.0 context-architecture redesign).

**v2.19.0** (May 2026) — **Token economy Phase 1+2**: artifact summaries (≤250 tokens, auto-generated) + task-aware memory filter (top-k relevant entries per task). –87.7% tokens per pipeline run.

**v2.17.0** (May 2026) — **companion plugins auto-install** · **Architecture / Spec / Schema critics** before Plan stage.

[Full changelog →](CHANGELOG.md)

## Roadmap

- **Evals runner in CI** — run golden-set eval suites on every PR, catch prompt regressions automatically
- **Self-improving loop** — agents that learn from verdicts and improve their own prompts over time
- **Decision scoring** — track which gate decisions turned out to be right; surface patterns
- **/crystallize** — promote high-impact lessons to reusable skills the whole pipeline can query
