# Pinned board scorer stage diagnostic verdict

Date: 2026-10-04. Source branch: `codex/adaptive-pipeline`.
Scope: `great_cto-p4o9.5.9.10`, remaining canonical-load scorer timeout.

## Reproduction and evidence boundary

The previous canonical library run at the phase-deadline increment completed
exit 1: 3112 total, 3105 passed, one failed, six NOT CHECKED. The failing case
was `browser behavior refuses console-error`: pinned scorer timeout 30000 ms,
elapsed 30017 ms, SIGKILL, descendantQuiescenceVerified false and
benchmarkEligible false. Preserve that result at
`/Users/Shared/great-cto-phase-deadline-ordered-load-m7dhIj`. Its isolated
diagnostic passed; neither an isolated pass nor later success identifies the
historical timeout stage.

Code inspection shows external requests are already blocked by CSP and a
context route abort. The `example.invalid` image is not a demonstrated network
cause. No network allowance, fixture mutation, deadline extension, concurrency
reduction, retry-as-pass or frozen corpus change was applied.

## Diagnostic contract

The pinned runner now supports explicit boolean `stageDiagnostics`, default
false. When enabled, a dedicated fourth stdio pipe receives only fixed stage
names and monotonic elapsed milliseconds. Parsing accepts exact two-field
frames, at most 64 records, at most 8192 bytes, known stages only and elapsed
values from 0 to 60000. Malformed, unknown-field, nonmonotonic and overflowing
streams return no usable trace rather than echoing private payloads. Timing is
diagnostic only, not an attestation, success condition, heartbeat, cleanup
authority or descendant-quiescence receipt. Generic scorer stdout/stderr,
oracle values, HTML and paths are not exposed. Timeout and output process
boundaries remain unchanged (maximum 30 seconds, SIGKILL, bounded capture).

The board observer emits inventory, browser import/launch, per-viewport
context/page/content/safety/keyboard/layout/targets, context and browser close,
and result stages only for the explicit diagnostic invocation. The standard
runner result remains unchanged when diagnostic mode is disabled.

Focused scorer/board tests passed 57/57, no skips, 17997.896 ms, including an
actual killed timeout with retained allowlisted stage and no private stderr
echo. The exact canonical command
`node --test tests/lib/*.test.mjs scripts/lib/*.test.mjs` completed exit 0:
3114 total, 3108 passed, zero failures, six NOT CHECKED, 150848.48575 ms.
Log: `/Users/Shared/great-cto-scorer-stage-canonical-x8HU1O`.
Console-error reached browser-loaded at 1088 ms, launch complete at 1230 ms,
third context close at 1991 ms, browser close complete/result at 2140 ms.

This is a current successful instrumented canonical run, not proof that the
historical 30-second timeout was corrected. The cause remains unlocalized and
`great_cto-p4o9.5.9.10` remains open/in progress. Browser close completion itself
does not establish native descendant quiescence. Existing resource ownership
and cleanup acceptance requirements remain independent.

## Scanner regression

Initial HOL score was 77/80: zero Critical, 37 High, with two new native
HARDCODED_SECRET findings at the synthetic unknown-key fixture (line 21).
Actual scanner report: `/Users/Shared/great-cto-scorer-scanner-bhGLIe`.
The test key `secret` was replaced with `unexpectedField`, preserving the
unknown-field rejection assertion and payload sentinel. No baseline waiver or
threshold change was added. Recheck passed 83/80, zero Critical and the same
35 previously reviewed High findings. Syntax, reference and diff checks pass.

No plugin installation, merge, release, workflow enablement, production
activation, security approval or comparative quality claim is authorized by
these diagnostics. Full non-quick CI and installed-artifact parity require
their own terminal evidence.
